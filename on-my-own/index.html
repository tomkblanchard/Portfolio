        <h3>Project Brief</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          On My Own (OMO) is a mobile app that aims to help people with
          disabilities to learn and practice independent living skills. While it
          is designed for people with disabilities, it is also helpful to anyone
          who wants to gain independent skills.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Gaining the neccessary skills to live independently can be challenging
          for many people. It can often be even more challenging for people with
          disabilities. While hands on learning and instuction in this area is
          extremely useful, tools that empower people with disabilities to self
          direct this process are limited.

          practice independent living skills, set self defined goals and

    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p class="text">
        On My Own (OMO) is a mobile app that aims to help people with
        disabilities to learn and practice independent living skills. While it
        is designed for people with disabilities, it is also helpful to anyone
        who wants to gain independent skills.
      </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Gaining the neccessary skills to live independently can be challenging
        for many people. It can often be even more challenging for people with
        disabilities. While hands on learning and instuction in this area is
        extremely useful, tools that empower people with disabilities to self
        direct this process are limited.
      </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The goal is to develop a mobile app that allows users to learn and
        practice independent living skills, set self defined goals and
        rewards, and track their progress on their journey to independent
        living.
      </p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p class="text">
      The process I followed was based on project goals and the scope of the problem, time constraints, and business needs. Here is the process I followed. 
    </p>

      <img src="images/Process.png" alt="Image of Design Process" />
    </div>
    <div id="understand" class="centerTitleContainer">
      <h1 class="centerTitle">Research</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Identify Key Stakeholders</h2>
    <p class="text">
      In order to best understand the business needs, I identified 4 key Stakeholders:
      <ul class="list">
        <li >
          <b>Persons with disabilities:</b> Children, adults, and young adults with intellectual, developmental or learning disabilities who are learning and practicing independent living skills. This segment is looking for easier, more fun, engaging and incentivized ways to work on their self-identified goals, and goals set from external expectations. Many people may find it easier to engage with learning and practicing ILS if the tool is fun, engageing and incentivising. 
        </li>
        <li >
          <b>Individuals with mental health challenges, behavioral issues:</b> Coping with mental health or behavior challenges can make many life activities more difficult, so a tool to assist with ILS could be useful to this population.
        </li>
        <li >
          <b>Parents of individuals described above:</b> Parents have a vested interest in seeing their children become more independent. Barriers to this goal can often be challenging for parents and families to navigate. Parents typically want their children to have a high quality of life, to feel fulfilled, happy, proud, self-sufficient (less reliant on them). Parents who take on the responsibility of facilitating and managing their children's ILS, for longer than what's typical, can cause stress, resentment and frustration.
        </li>
        <li >
          <b>Service Providers (social services workers, therapists, psychiatrists, group home staff, etc.):</b> Service providers benefit from tools that help their clients achieve their goals. By introducing tools to empower their clients to become more self-sufficient and independent will not only help with their success rate --which could potentially increase funding-- but it will also feel like they have provided a useful service to their clients.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Empathize through User Research </h2>
    <p class="text">
      Before any design efforts took place, it was crucial to conduct user research. I conducted a series of interviews with users to gain pain points and insights. 
    </p>
      <p class="text pMargin">For the rest of the day we focused on research. My team and I played a total of
      15 games, noting any aspects we thought we could incorporate in our game design.
      Some of the games we played that informed our design were:
      <ul class="list">
        <li >
          Risk
        </li>
        <li >
          Pandemic
        </li>
        <li >
          Mafia
        </li>
        <li >
          Among Us
        </li>
        <li >
          Wereworlf
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Next, my team and I read through The Green New Deal and researched absurdism philosophy. To meet the course requirements, we needed to design a game that struck a balance between interactivity, environmental awareness, and absurdism.
    </p>
    <div class="centerTitleContainer">
      <h1 class="centerTitle">Diverge</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      On day 2 we focused on generating broad ideas based on several categories: game theme, mechanics, background story, our research findings, and the assignment requirements. In the morning I facilitated a brainstorm session for each design category to gather all possible ideas. We then decided on a broad direction we wanted to take the game. To further home in on what we wanted each of our design categories to acheive, I conducted a "How might we..." exercise. After the exercise, we organized our cards and went through another round of brainstoring to find possible solutions to each card.

      Using the information we gathered, we launched into rapid prototyping where each team member was tasked with sketching a prototype.
    </p>
    <div class="centerTitleContainer">
      <h1 class="centerTitle">Decide</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      On the morning of day 3, we stuck our protoypes up on the wall. Using sticky notes, we each ranked and voted on the designs. As project manager, I had the responsibility of being decider. I decided on the design that I thought best incorporated all categories: a collaborative, turn based board game with the goal of "fill the board with chips". The board was a map with gridlines that created spaces on which players could move, and the game play relied on dice rolling and card drawing mechanics to dictate movement and chip placement. Once the decision was made, we began story boarding and sketching in preparation for prototyping. We also began preparing for our day 5 play testing session by creating a Google form to elicate feedback. 
    </p>
    <div class="centerTitleContainer">
      <h1 class="centerTitle">Prototype</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      On day 4, using the chosen prototype design and storyboards, I broke down each element of the design challenge into specific tasks and delegated them to the team. The tasks included the design of the board (its pieces and mechanics), character cards, scenario cards, mystery cards, game rules, and background story. We then used markers, glue sticks, and paper to complete our first prototype.
    </p>
    <h2> Prototype 1 Game Design Overview</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Two teams fight against each other to defend their beleifs about climate change and gain control of the world. To protect the environemt, team "Beleivers" try to cover the map with “recycle” chips, and team "Deniers" use “CO2” chips to cover the map in the effort to protect their livelyhoods and beleif that climate change does not exist.
    </p>
    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li >
        Moving around a gridded board made up of bodies of land and water; each square on the grid is one space. 
      </li>
      <li >
        Taking turns: teams take turns mvoing around the board.
      </li>
      <li >
        Rolling numbered dice to determine number of spaces to move.
      </li>
      <li >
        Rolling weather dice to determine good or bad weather.
      </li>
      <li >
        Spinning weather spinner to determine direction of movement (NESW)
      </li>
      <li >
        Placing team chips on sections of land to take control of that section.
      </li>
      <li >
        Drawing character cards to create teams.
      </li>
      <li >
        Drawing scenario cards to determine chip placement.
      </li>
      <li >
        Drawing mystery cards to introduce randomness and alter game play.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prototype</h3>

    </div>
    <p class="text">
      On day 5 we tested our game with 3 groups of players: a group of 2 players, a group of 4 players, and a group of 5 players. The goal was to aquire as much feedback as possible. To do this we gave the rules and instructions to the players and explained as little as possible about the game. My team and I then observed the game play and took notes on anything we thought was important. We tried to capture how we could improve the game by noting when players found anything confusing or unclear, aspects of game play where players demonstrated joy or seemd to be having fun, and any unintended game play that we found improved or detracted from the experience.

    <h2 class="title">Measuring Results</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Once testing was finished, we gave each play tester a survey to gather feedback based on their experience, to help us improve subsiquent iterations of our design. The Google form we created included multiple choice questions, open ended questions and a section of Likert scale questions. These are the questions we included:

    <div class="centerTitleContainer">
      <h2 class="centerTitle">Retrospective</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="text">
      The next important step was to go through a retrospective. The following day, I facilitated a structured meeting in which I first outlined the goal for the retrospective. Next, after walking through highlights of our design sprint, I solicited feedback on things that went well and what challenges we faced. To wrap up the meeting, we evaluated the survey responses we received from play testers. Survey responses showed the following areas for improvement: 
    </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="item">
          <b>Writing and clarity of rules: </b>testers found the rules and instructions on how to play to be unclear and not well organized. 
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <b>Selecting teams: </b>testers found team division confusing, especially with an odd number of players.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <b>Weather spinner: </b>testers thought the weather spinner was confusing due to the fact that it was not functional in the first prototype. 
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          <b>Game board: </b>testers did not like the genaric triangles on the map and thought something more relatable would connect better. 
        </li>
      </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="title">Prototype 2</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Taking all feedback and observations from our first play testing session, my team and I followed the same design sprint structure to deliver prototype 2. During this sprint we focused on addressing feedback by makeing the following changes: 
      <ol class="list">
        <li class="item">
          Structure, organization, and wording in the rule book and instructions in order to simplify and clarify. This also extended to instructing players on hoe to form teams. 
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          We mounted a functional weather spinner to the board to ensure better game play. 
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          In terms of the aesthetics, we pivoted from the generic "continents" design and went with a more recognizable map of the globe. However, we trimmed off edges of each continent to improve player movement, and to fit the game narrrative that climate change had contributed to extensive rise in sea level. 
        </li>
      </ol>

    <p class="text">
      During our last design sprint, we designed our final prototype. While my team finished designing player pieces, cards, writing instructions, rules and story background, I designed the board. To acheive the highest level of quality possible, I chose to have the final board laser printed on hardwood. I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to design the board, dice, and chips, and used the designs to print the final prototype.

    <h2 class="title">Final Outcome</h2>
    <p class="text">
      After iterating over several prototypes, my team and I delivered a tabletop game that incorporated creative solutions to our design challenge. Data collected from surveys given to our final round of play testers showed the following relusts: 
      <ol class="list">
        <li class="item">Interactivity & level of "Fun": 92% of testers found the game play to be fun and engageing. 87% of testers attributed this to the mystery cards that prompted players to do silly things like singing songs, posing as a tree, or stealing cards from players on the opposing team.</li>
        <li class="item">Incorporating The Green New Deal: 78% of those surveyed found that we addressed climate change awareness in our game. This was acheived by the background story, overall game play and mechanics, and inclusion of climate change themes included in character descriptions, scenario cards and mystery cards.</li>
        <li class="item">Incorporating Absurdism: This was by far the most challenging aspect to include in our game. 73% of those surveyed thought that we adiquately included absurdist philosophy in our game through the mystery cards, as they dramatically changed the game, hindering each teams progress. This criterion was also met by how we designed the game: it was close to impossible to win, and could go on forever. </li>
      </ol> 
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">Reflections</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Throughout this project I learned a lot about game design, as well as design in general. By following design sprints to quickly create prototypes, test them, and jump into the next iteration, allowed my team and I to follow a process to think through and come up with creative solutions to interesting design challneges. I also learned a great deal about project management. Keeping my team on track, facilitating design sprint exercises (which often lead to productive disagreements), and distributing tasks, proved to be a fun challenge.

      The most challenging aspect my team faced was writing. Translating our ideas and vision (that we were intimately familiar with through the design process) into instructions and rules for players to follow proved difficult. This feedback came up after each prototype we tested. To address this, we did substantial research on game rule and instruction writing in an attempt to simplify our writing in order to provide the best gaming experience. In future design projects, clarity in writing will be a high priority.
